WARNING: This app is currently WIP (really..)

The current only option in the main menu only works works only with files in a folder without subfolders.

You should really run it with dryrun und confirm choices first.

I used it to organize my audible audiobooks and it works most of the time and most big bugs should be purged.

What really needs improvement is the searching for metadata specially on google books.

If you test it, please report back over issues.
